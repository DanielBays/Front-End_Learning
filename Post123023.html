                Learning to code in your late 20s seems like the best time to do but, I've
                been attempting to learn the fundamental programming languages for over two years now and have failed to do so. 
                This website is my accountability buddy to help me stay focused on this path. I'm not sure how long it will take but I will
                continue to document my experience and will hopefully become a developer when all is said and done.
                I am going to keep this short and sweet and hope you all have a great New Years!<br><br>
                Thank you,<br><br>
