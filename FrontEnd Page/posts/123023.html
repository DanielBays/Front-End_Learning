                Changing career fields in your late 20s seems like the best time to do so, so why not start now? In reality, i've
                been attempting to learn the fundamental programming languages for over two years now and have failed to do so. 
                This website is my accountability buddy to help me stay focused on this path. I'm not sure how long it will take but I will
                continue to document my experience and maybe this website will inspire someone else on their journey to become a developer
                or whatever else you are pursuing. I am going to keep this short and sweet and hope you all have a great New Years!<br><br>
                Thank you,<br><br>
