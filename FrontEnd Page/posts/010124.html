                &nbsp; &nbsp; With the new year, I have some New Year's resolutions of my own. These resolutions are going to be focused around my professional 
                growth as a coder and my knowledge with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to code every weekday for at least an hour.
                I want to have three projects to add to my portfolio. I want to design a professionally designed portfolio by the beginning of June.
                I think it's important to keep goals achievable, and I would love to say I will start my new career as a Front-End Developer but with 
                the research I've done, I think that will be more likely to occur in 2025 when I am able to network with more developers.
                I am still very new to all of this, and my goals may morph depending on new knowledge and the experience I gain from this journey.
                I am still working on setting up socials for this journey to help you all follow along if you would like. I would also love any feedback.
                and constructive criticism. I want to improve, and I know I will mess up (a lot) along the way. Please be patient with me and help.
                keep me accountable! <br><br>
                Best Regards and Happy New Years! <br>
